=head1 NAME

Hash::Persistent - nested hashref serializable to the file

=head1 VERSION

version 1.00

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Hash::Persistent;

    $obj = Hash::Persistent->new("./obj.state"); # give a file to keep state
    $obj->{string} = "hello world"; # and use just like a regular perl hash
    $obj->commit; # save the data to the state file
    $obj->{string} = "world hello";
    undef $obj; # force destroying; data will not be saved

    $obj = Hash::Persistent->new("./obj.state", { auto_commit => 1 });
    $obj->{string} = "hello world";
    undef $obj; # the last update is commited

    $obj = Hash::Persistent->new("./obj.state", { read_only => 1 }); # do not flock
    print $obj->{string};
    $obj->{string} = "hello"; # ok, local modifications
    $obj->commit; # dies, cannot commit a readonly persistent

    $obj = Hash::Persistent->new("./obj.state", {}, {blocking => 0}); # pass some options to flock call

    $obj = Hash::Persistent->new("./obj.state", {format => "storable"});
    undef $obj; # recode state into storable format

    foreach my $key (%$obj) {} # $obj is guaranteed not to contain any internal keys

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Hash::Persistent> serializes its data to the single file using L<Data::Dumper>, L<Storable> or L<JSON>.

The object reads the state from given file when created, and writes the new state when destroyed.
No multithreading - the file is locked with C<flock> while object exists.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item B<< new($options, $lock_options) >>

These constructor options are supported:

=over

=item I<auto_commit>

If true, state will be commited when object is destroyed.

It is recommended not to turn this option on and call C<commit()> explicitly every time, because perl ignores all exceptions thrown from destructors.

Off by default.

=item I<read_only>

If set, object can't be commited, I<auto_commit> can't be set, and object won't try to obtain a lock.

Off by default.

=item I<write_only>

Supressing the loading of data from an existing file. Useful for generating a new state and avoid failures if the previous one is currupted. It also can be used for minor performance improvements.

Off by default.

=item I<lock>

If true, take the global waiting lock for the whole lifetime of the object.

On by default.

=item I<mode>

If set, it will chmod the output file to the given value after each commit.

=item I<format>

Possible values: B<dumper>, B<storable>, B<json>.

If not specified and file already exists, will be detected automatically. If not specified and file doesn't exist, B<json> will be used as default.

B<json> format is fast, readable and secure, but can't serialize objects.

B<dumper> format is human-readable and can serialize objects, but insecure and slow.

B<storable> format can serialize objects and fast, but unreadable by humans and insecure.

=back

Additionally, any C<Lock::File> options can be passed as a third parameter.

=item B<< commit() >>

Write data on disk.

File will be written in atomic fashion, using tmpfile, so when disk is full, data will not be lost.

=item B<< remove() >>

Remove persistent file.

This method is lock-unsafe, which means that you shouldn't try to create persistent file again soon after this call.
